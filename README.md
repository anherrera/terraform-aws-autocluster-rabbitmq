# terraform-aws-autocluster-rabbitmq

This repo contains a [Terraform](https://terraform.io/) module to provision a rabbitmq cluster using docker, and autoscaling groups of AWS.


Enabled rabbitmq plugins
---------------

- Autocluster
- Consistent Hash Exchange
- Delayed Message Exchange
- Federation
- Federation Management
- Management
- Management Visualiser
- Message Timestamp
- MQTT
- Recent History Exchange
- Sharding
- Shovel
- Shovel Management
- Stomp
- Top
- WebStomp

What is included in this module
------------------------------
* Creation and provisioning of the rabbitmq cluster's nodes using docker image gavinmroy/alpine-rabbitmq-autocluster which supports the autocluster plugin of rabbitmq using aws autoscale groups
* Creation of autoscale group/ launch configurations (and the iam roles/policies required)
* ELB to access rabbitmq 5672 port and the admin console (thourgh port 80 and 15672)
* Posibility to setup the ELB to be internet-faced but it will be created private by default.
* Security groups for the ELB/instances -> by default, traffic is allowed from within inside the VPC CIDR blocks


Requirements
--------------
* VPC is required (see [terraform-multitier-vpc](https://github.com/grey-systems/terraform-multitier-vpc) to create an enabled HA vpc in AWS

Usage
--------
Module usage:

      provider "aws" {
        access_key = "${var.access_key}"
        secret_key = "${var.secret_key}"
        region     = "${var.region}"
      }

    # minimal setup, check Inputs to see the different customisation options
     module "rabbitmq" {
         source                                = "github.com/teamleadercrm/terraform-aws-autocluster-rabbitmq.git?ref=master"
         public_subnet_ids                     = "${var.public_subnet_ids}"
         private_subnet_ids                    = "${var.private_subnet_ids}"
         availability_zones                    = "${var.availability_zones}"
         aws_keypair_name                      = "${var.aws_keypair_name}"
         environment                           = "${var.environment}"
  }
